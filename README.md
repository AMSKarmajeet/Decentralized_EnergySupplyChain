# Decentralized_EnergySupplyChain, My solution to optimize Energy supply chain
## Title of my Project
### Optimization of Energy supply chain using Blockchain Technology and to reduce energy wastage.  
## Common problem to address
As we know, our institute IIT Varanasi every roof top are covered with solar panel makes it a clean energy producer.
But, during our vacation when entire Varanasi faces lack of energy, megawatts of energy produced in our institute get wasted. Because conventional Energy supply chain now is full of red tape maze and slow that doesnâ€™t allow energy saver like us to trade.
Similarly we can understand today's society needs a very fast and real time trading energy supply chain  instead slow and seasonal. And to avoid energy wastage we need to create trading opportunities for end user energy saver like us.  
This inspired us to work in the energy usage management and supply chain context.

(Note:- I had done this project under mentorship of Schneider electric co. as an youth empowerment programme during my last summer, and i am the main author of this project. Now i am trying my best to implement this here in my collage)

## Challenges to Energy supply chain:-
* conventional energy supply has high operation cost.
* Need a feasible solution to open multiple energy supply point wherever required.
* cyber threat problem in automated grid.
* lack of automated billing and red tape maze in power consumption.
* Real time trading is more beneficial than seasonal trading but conventional energy supply chain in India is unable to adopt it because they need a proper software solution for this.
* maintaining demand and supply equilibrium.

## My Solution
-Control the utility grid using IoT power meter (Prototype was made using Aurdino Micro controller) .
-Connect to power meter with your smartphone to unlock and join the supply chain wherever needed (Cryptographic encryption method used).
 -install my ethereum DAPP and create a cryptocurrancy wallet to save some amount here.
-On access to energy direct payment will be done from your wallet. It makes billing quite simple.
-Blockchain boosts Cybersecurity and reduces operation cost and allow us to open multiple supply points wherever required for example across the road.

## Create more opportunity for End Users.
-In parallel connect each end user energy supply point to Microgrid controlled by IoT.
 -it will allow them to trade their saved or produced energy.
 -collected energy from end user as distributed sources and then feed it to main supply point and pay the energy saver.

## Software solution for Automation.
-price of electricity at instant is partial function of various factors.
-Our programed app using Matlab can automatically audit the transaction by solving the  P.D.E. 

## Few of its more credits.
-Real time demand-supply data generated from IoT can be used to detect the optimal cost of energy, hence allow distributor to trade at eqilibrium.

-In our model we can inculcate the behavioural change of consumer and reduces energy overuse, because now they are equally responsible for the 
change in energy cost at every instant.

## My user interface (Decentralised App)
As far as today's society target for more digitalised, decentralised, electric, decarbonised future is concerned, our model is suitable as blockchain is the decentralised.

## through this model we aim to make available electricity to all with low operational cost, I believe "electricity is the humans basic right" in addition proper electricity supply can eliminate use of fossil fuel and can achieve the target of going green in the city.   
 
I AM GRATEFUL TO SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC AND MY MENTOR ANUPAMA JAYAKUMAR MA'AM FOR GUIDING ME THIS FAR.
